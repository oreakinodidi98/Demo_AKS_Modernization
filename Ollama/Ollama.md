# Deploying Ollama on Kubernetes

> Run large language models on your cluster the same way you run any other workload — GPU-aware, and ready for your team.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running any of the deployments or scripts in this demo, make sure you have the following:

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Azure CLI** | `az` installed and authenticated (`az login`) |
| **kubectl** | Configured to talk to your AKS cluster (`az aks get-credentials`) |
| **AKS Cluster** | A running AKS cluster — GPU node pool required for Stages 3–5 |
| **Python 3.10+** | Required to run `CallApi.py` |
| **pip packages** | `requests` (required), `openai` (optional — for OpenAI-compatible endpoint) |
| **Kubernetes namespace** | Create the target namespace before deploying: `kubectl create namespace ollama` |
| **Helm** *(optional)* | Only if deploying ArgoCD from scratch |

Install the Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install requests
# Optional: for OpenAI-compatible endpoint
pip install openai
```

## Why Ollama

Ollama turns running a large language model into something as simple as pulling a container image. Simplified — it's a **free, self-hosted alternative to ChatGPT**. It handles model downloads, quantization, and serving behind a clean REST API — no ML platform expertise required.

You run your own LLM models on your own hardware. Useful if you have **privacy concerns** or have your own homelab. Very popular open-source project with models comparable to ChatGPT. Caveat — if not running on GPUs, it's not as fast.

**vLLM** is built for maximum throughput in production inference pipelines. **Ollama** is built for ease of use. If your goal is internal tools, dev environments, or giving your team LLM capabilities without the overhead of a full ML serving stack — Ollama is the right choice.

## What This Guide Covers

This guide walks through deploying Ollama on Kubernetes, including:

- **Model Deployment** — downloading, serving, and swapping models
- **GPU configuration** — scheduling onto GPU nodes and setting resource limits
- **Running in Docker** — simple local setup

---

## Using Docker

```bash
docker run -it --name ollama -p 11434:11434 ollama/ollama
```

> **Important:** The Ollama container is a **framework** — it doesn't include any models out of the box. You need to download them separately after starting the container.

Exec into the running container and pull a model:

```bash
docker exec -it ollama ollama run llama3.2
```

### The Problem with `exec`

This pattern **doesn't scale** for Kubernetes or enterprise teams. Every time a pod spins up, you can't just exec into it and manually pull models — that's a non-starter.

### Workarounds

There are a few ways to handle model loading without manual intervention:

1. **Bake models into a custom image** — build a new image with the models pre-installed. Works, but creates **very large images** (7B model ≈ 4GB+).

2. **Mount a persistent volume** — store models on a **PVC** so you only download them once. New pods pick up the existing cache on startup.

3. **Use the Ollama API to pull models** — Ollama exposes a `/api/pull` endpoint. Hit it after the pod starts:

```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/api/pull -d '{
    "name": "llama3.2"
}'
```

4. **Sidecar with a postStart hook** — you might think to use an init container to run the curl command, but init containers run **before** the main container starts — so there's no Ollama server to talk to yet. The fix is to add a **sidecar container** with a `lifecycle.postStart` hook that curls the Ollama API to pull models when the pod first comes up. This is what `DeploySimple.yaml` does.

### Gotchas

> These will bite you in production if you're not aware of them.

**postStart timeout** — The postStart hook must complete within `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` (default **30s**). If you're pulling multiple large models — say `llama3.1:8b`, `mistral:7b`, `codellama:13b`, and `nomic-embed-text` — that's **30GB+ of downloads**. There's no way that finishes in 30 seconds. The result: `FailedPostStartHook` → `CrashLoopBackOff`. For multi-model pulls, use a **Job** or script that runs *after* the pod is healthy instead.

**RWO PVC with multiple replicas** — If your PVC is set to `ReadWriteOnce`, only **one node** can mount it. With `replicas: 3`, the remaining pods will sit in `Pending` or `ContainerCreating` forever. Switch to `ReadWriteMany` (e.g. Azure Files) if you need multi-replica access to the same model cache.

## Querying Ollama

Ollama uses port **11434** by default. To reach it from outside the cluster, expose the service with a **port-forward**:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/ollama 8000:11434 -n ollama
```

Once a model is loaded, query it with:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/generate -d '{
    "model": "llama3.1:8b",
    "prompt": "in exactly 12 words or less explain why the sky is blue.",
    "stream": false
}'
```

Pipe through `jq` to extract just the response text:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/generate -d '{
    "model": "llama3.1:8b",
    "prompt": "in exactly 12 words or less explain why the sky is blue.",
    "stream": false
}' | jq -r .response
```
